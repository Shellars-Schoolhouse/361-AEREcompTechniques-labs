\section{Midpoint Rule}

The Midpoint Rule has ${O(1)}$ complexity. This means there is a constant time regardless of the inputs size. The function depends on only one input varaible.

\section{Simpson's 1/3}

The Simpson's 1/3 Rule has ${O(1)}$ complexity. This means there is a constant time regardless of the inputs size. The function depends on only one input varaible. 


\newpage

\section{Simpson's 3/8}

The Simpson's 3/8 Rule has ${O(1)}$ complexity. This means there is a constant time regardless of the inputs size. The function depends on only one input varaible.


\newpage

\section{Gauss Quad}

The Gauss Quad Rule has ${O(n)}$ complexity. This means there is linear growth in the time as the input size increases. This is created by the for loop iterating through ${i}$.
