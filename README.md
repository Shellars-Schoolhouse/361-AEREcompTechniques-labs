# 361-AEREcompTechniques-labs 

All labs were instructional from Iowa State University, and had strong guidance from the Prof. and TA's. The grade received for each lab is denoted below, with comments for missing points. 
The entire lab manual is attached, and I've also attached a pdf form of _C Programming Language_ by Brian K and Dennis R, so use as needed. 

I highly recommend checking out my Professor's, Dr. Kristin Rozier, [website](http://temporallogic.org/courses/AERE361/).

**Note:**

* Lab 8 was partnered, mine is Logan Heying
* Our class did not do lab 12
